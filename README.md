The "Battleship" folder was the last assignment to create classes which could be used to make a program which plays a classic game of Battleship. 
The ship class represents a ship which has a name, a length, a number representing damage, and methods to track damage and each data member. 
The board class represents a 10x10  grid that held some number of ships. It held two 10x10 arrays, one for which squares have been attacked, one for ship pointers to keep track of ship occupancy on the grid, a variable keeping track of how many ships have been sunk, and methods to determine ships unsunk, retreive elements of each array, and place ships on the grid.
